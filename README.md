# Predicting Employee retention (HR Department)

One of the biggest challenges of managers and businesses is hiring and retaining top talent. The hiring process is extremely rigorous, expensive and time consuming.

Companies spend around 20% of an employee's salary to hire a replacement.
For top 500 companies, hiring a new employee cost an average of $7465
It takes 52 days on average to fill a position.


My Task on this project was to develop a model to predict which employees are most likely to quit based on the extensive data collected from the employee database.
